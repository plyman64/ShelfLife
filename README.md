My first big coding project, the foundations of a game about picking up trash on the beach and crafting stuff with it

To launch the game:

1. Download the zip of this repository and extract it
2. Download Processing 3.5.4 from here: https://processing.org/releases
3. Run any of the .pde files
4. Click the "Run"/play button in the top left corner of the Processing window that opens

*5. You will encounter a blank screen after clicking "New Game." Click one more time to begin playing.

Controls:

WSAD = Move
i = inventory/crafting
